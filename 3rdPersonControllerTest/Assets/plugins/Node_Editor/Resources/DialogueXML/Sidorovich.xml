            <text>Let's make a deal. I got three jobs that needs to be done, and nobody around here has the balls to do any of them. I can't send Razor because he's the chief of my guards; and let's just be direct - these jobs can get you killed, and I can't afford to lose Razor. But if you get these jobs done for me - and I don't care how you do it - not only will I let you through my gate, but I'll also guide you deeper into the zone. What do you think?</text>

            <text>Good! Here's the first job: right outside the village, up north, there is a barn which we have been using to grow potatoes. We hate eating potatoes but we use them to produce alcohol.</text>

            <text>You see, the alcohol is our main trade - the eggheads among the mutant hunters pay a lot of dough for it, and that's how we've been surviving. But recently a bunch of assholes who call themselves "Legionaires" raided our farm and took it for themselves, along with all the distillers. And that puts us in some deep shit. </text>

            <text>Exactly. Get rid of the Legionaires; and if you can, check on the potatoes for us, they probably haven't been watered for a long time. The farm is directly north from the village, on the other side of the hill. I'll go head and tell Razor to let you through the gate. Now grab your gun and get to it!</text>

            <text>For the past several months, the Legionnaires held the train station, so the only way out of Zernaskaya is through the sewers under the church. Since we haven't been there for a while, the whole area got overrun with gouls. </text>
