            <text>They are humans at the first stage of mutation after contracting the Tungus Complex. They aren't too dangerous individually, but if many of them gang up on you in a tight space, it's certain death. I need you to clear the Ghouls so we can use the underground sewer to transport goods out. By the way, talk to Hans before you leave. He lives in that L-shaped house. I heard he needed some help. </text>

            <text>Well, I haven't seen it myself, but I heard it can repair your weapon automatically - if you do it right. I don't know how it works exactly so I need you to investigate. Here, take some worn pistols and experiment with them. And this old AK too - I need you to bring it back to me in perfect conditions. You can't fool me, though. A gun with perfect conditions is very hard to come by in the Zone. Good luck.</text>

            <text>The train station was taken by the Legionnaires. These are not your everyday bandits you encountered at the potato farm. They are much better equipped so you may want to sneak through the station at night, instead of going in guns blazing. Your pea shooter stands no chance against them.

            <text>I like you already! I got three jobs that needs to be done, and nobody around here has the balls to do any of them. I can't send Razor because he's the chief of my guards; and let's just be clear - these jobs can get you killed, and I can't afford to lose Razor. But if you get these jobs done for me, I'll tell you where to find Boris. What do you think?</text>

            <text>You see, the alcohol is our main trade - the eggheads among the mutant hunters pay a lot of dough for it, and that's how we've been surviving. But recently a bunch of assholes who call themselves "Legionaires" raided our farm and took it for themselves, along with all the distillers. And that puts us in some deep shit. </text>

            <text>Exactly. Get rid of the Legionaires; and if you can, fix the irrigation for us, and I'll give you a bonus. The farm is directly north from the village, on the other side of the hill. I'll go head and tell Razor to let you through the gate. Now grab your gun and get to it!</text>
