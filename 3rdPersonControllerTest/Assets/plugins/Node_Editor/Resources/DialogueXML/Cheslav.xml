            <text>Because they wanted my armor set. Last week I found this ceramic plate armor and a helmet from Station 11 with my partner. We couldn't agree on who gets to wear it, so I hid them behind the gas station behind his back. But that son of a bitch sold me to the Legionnaires! So here I am, locked up, tortured and forced to eat dog food sandwich.</text>
