            <text>Ah, yes! I appreciate your offer. I'm working on a device, a detector that can warn you before you step into an anomaly. And my intention is simple - I just want to make some money selling it, to be honest.</text>

            <text>Building this device is not easy, though. First I needed money to buy components. I got help from folks in Zernaskaya - they each gave me some money and in return I'll give them the device for free. I call it "crowd funding", you see?</text>

            <text>No, not money - that has been taken care of. I need data. Each anomaly is different and the detector must posess a set of parameters for each type of anomaly to detect it. There used to be a man whom they called "The Priest", I heard that he did some research on the anomalies.</text>

            <text>He was a legend, and there are a lot of stories about him. You can ask around the camp and people will tell you all about him. But he hasn't been seen or heard from since last year.</text>

            <text>I don't know why they call him "The Priest", but I guess it's because he lived in the church. I believe he has some documents there of his study. If you could retrieve the documents for me, that will really help with my progress.</text>

            <text>Terrific! The church is northwest of the village, near the barn house. Be careful though, that area is infested with Ghouls.</text>
