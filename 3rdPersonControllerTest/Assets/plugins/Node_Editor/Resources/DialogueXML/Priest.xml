            <text>The name's Romanoff. You might have heard people referring to me as "The Priest". They are damn right I'm a priest! Honor graduate from Leningrad Theological Academy in 1954 and I've been a priest until 1978.</text>

            <text>Well, I was naiive. Even at the age of 56. When I learned about the Visitations, the ghouls and the serums, I thought the End was coming. I wanted to come here and get a glimpse of the Revelation. But I was wrong - it was just another chapter of humanity, of greed and bloodthirst.</text>

            <text>In the past few years I've been working on serum recipes, hoping to find something that can help the sick - that's the least I can do. I used myself as guinea pig. Last year I made a mistake and poisoned myself. My eyes slowly gave in, and I set up this safe house before I was completely blind.</text>

            <text>I have a friend who's been helping me, trading supplies for my serum. But he hasn't showed up for two weeks and my supply is low. So perhaps... you could help me out?</text>

            <text>Did Sidorovich send you here? I knew it! That greedy bastard. Be careful when you work for him - he only cares about his money and wouldn't blink an eye while watching you get torn up by anomalies. What does he want exactly?</text>

            <text>I see. Here's the key. The Mad Mechanic is not very forgiving. One wrong move and your rifle is gone. Experiment with it a bit with some pistols and try to figure out the pattern.</text>
