            <text>You must be talking about some rookie who worked here. I deal with a dozen and one rookies a day, so I can't remember any body. Go talk to Dr. Sidorovich. By the way, If you don't see him around here, he's probably already dead.</text>

            <text>You see, we are in a bit of trouble here. We are forced to take advantage of rookies like you. Either you pay your way through or do some work for us.</text>
